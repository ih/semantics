* next
** test evaluate on expression '(cons 1 '())
use the interactive debugger http://www.gnu.org/software/guile/docs/docs-1.8/guile-ref/Interactive-Debugger.html
*** implement apply-primitive procedure
** explore the idea of pushing forward a lambda abstraction as "unification"
* past
currently trying to get (evaluate 'cons) to work
** implement lookup-variable-value
*** DONE implement scan
*** DONE write test for scan
more generally make an environment for testing eval
* outline
** interpreter
*** features
**** applying semantics
output of functions can be partially determined based on the semantics
**** learning semantics
common sequences of operations are abstracted and added as functions in the language
*** applications
**** binary string generation
generative model for binary strings
**** warehouse world
the domain presented in angelic semantics papers by russell's group
***** reimplement warehouse world
***** apply abstraction code to learning high level actions
